<body>There are five members in my family. My mom, my dad, my sister and of course our dog.
My 22 year old sister just graduated from the University of Santa Clara and is now working back home in Sweden.
My mom is a florist and works at a flower shop in Stockholm.
My dad works at a bank and has for the past 30 years. My dog is a golden retriever and is now 13 years old.
We are a tight knit group. And I miss them a lot during the time we spend part.
